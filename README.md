# EnchantedBaubles
A Minecraft mod that allows enchantements on Baubles. Still heavily work in progress.

**Note**: If you want to run the mod in a development environment, you'll have to put
```-Dfml.coreMods.load=goldenapple.enchbaubles.asm.EnchBaublesLoadingPlugin``` in the *VM* arguments 
(*not* the Program arguments). Otherwise FML won't load the built-in coremod, and the mod won't work.
