# EnchantedBaubles
A Minecraft mod that allows enchantements on Baubles. It kinda compiles, but most of the enchantments don't function yet. It uses the [EnchantedAPI] (https://github.com/goldenapple3/EnchantedAPI) and obviously the [Baubles] (https://github.com/azanor/Baubles) API.

**Note**: If you want to run the mod in a development environment, you'll need a deobfuscated version of EnchantedAPI in your /mods/ folder. It's build.gradle should give you a proper deobfuscated jar , though.
